<h1>Design of a Fuzzy KB Supported by Fingrams</h1>

<h2>Generate, Visualize, and Analyze Fingrams</h2>

				<td>This step allows to create and analyze fingrams from the system previously induced.
				Fingrams are graphical representations of the system. The rules are represented by nodes,
				and the links represent the relations among rules in terms of cofiring degree. Moreover, the
				graph is simplified keeping the most relevant relations through the use of Pathfinder algorithm. 
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>The first window shows the different fingrams available along with a summary of quality indicators related to the fuzzy system under design.
				The top part of the window allows to select the fingrams that can be viewed, while the
				inferior part gives information about system quality, and provides a legend aimed at making easy
				to understand the information embedded into fingrams.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Three fingrams are created: one complete with all the original links 
				(Original Fingram), one	pruned from the original one (PFNET: Consistency and Redundancy), 
				and one showing just the potential inconsistency among rules (PFNET: Only Consistency).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>In case you click "DO", then the generated fingrams are automatically displayed.
				It is easy to appreciate how rules R1, R23, R35 and R37 can be removed without jeopardizing accuracy (it is only slightly reduced).
				You can remove such rules just by clicking on them, in one of the displayed fingrams.
				As a result, such rules are deactivated in the list of rules while fingrams are updated and displayed again.
				Of course, you can activate them again later.</td>
