        USER CONTRACT FOR GUAJE DISTRIBUTION
************************************************************
************************************************************

GUAJE was conceived and produced by Jose Maria Alonso Moral as an updated and enhanced version of KBCT.
GUAJE stands for Generating Understandable and Accurate Fuzzy Models in a Java Environment.

1-Preamble

The authors wish free circulation within the scientific community and professional applications in a cooperative spirit. 
To this end they have decided to distribute GUAJE as open source software under GPL-v3 license. 

GUAJE is freely available at:
http://sourceforge.net/p/guajefuzzy/

For further details about GPL-v3 license, go to:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

Notice that, GUAJE copyrights remain the property of Jose Maria Alonso Moral.
The signing of the present document commits the respect of the GPL license.

GUAJE makes calls to several auxiliar free software tools whose libraries are released
with GUAJE (respecting their related licenses, of course):

* It calls to jnifis.dll (jnifis.so), a c++ library of FisPro for treating fuzzy logic.
It is used in order to do inferences, to induce partitions and rules from data.
You can obtain FisPro at:
	http://www7.inra.fr/mia/M/fispro/
	fispro@supagro.inra.fr 
It is distributed under CeCILL and GSL license. FisPro copyrights remain the property of INRA.

* FingramsGenerator (Stand-alone software tool able to generate and visualize fingrams)
GUAJE makes use of the library provided by FingramsGenerator to generate and visualize fuzzy inference-grams (fingrams).
This software is licensed under GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)
http://sourceforge.net/p/fingrams/wiki/Home/

* Batik (SVG Toolkit)
GUAJE calls to Batik libraries for visualizing the SVG files previously generated with Graphviz.
Batik is freely available and licensed according to the Apache License, Version 2.0.
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/

* Jama (Java Matrix Package)
GUAJE makes use of Jama-1.0.2.jar for computing metrics related to Fingrams. Namely for computing PageRank.
Jama is a cooperative product of the MathWorks and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
which has been released freely to the public domain:
http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/

* ORE (Ontology Rule Editor)
GUAJE makes use of ORE libraries for browsing domain ontologies with the aim of making easier 
expert knowledge extraction tasks. ORE is free software distributed under GPL-v3 license:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ore/

* Espresso (Logic Minimization Software)
GUAJE calls to Espresso as part of the Logical View analysis.
A free software for heuristic boolean minimization. The original algorithm was developed at IBM by Robert Brayton.
We have used the implementation freely available at:
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cs4861/s07-sis/

* Weka (Data Mining)
GUAJE makes use of some of the algorithms (SimpleKmeans and J48) provided with Weka.
It is freely available under GPL-v3 license:
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/

* KEEL (Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning)
GUAJE calls to one of the SMOTE algorithms provided with KEEL.
KEEL is freely available under GPL-v3 license:
http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/

* XFUZZY (Fuzzy Logic Design Tool)
GUAJE calls to one of the packages provided by Xfuzzy, the one responsible for synthesis of Java source code.
XFUZZY is available under GPL license:
https://forja.rediris.es/projects/xfuzzy/

* IzPack and PackJacket have been used for building the GUAJE installer. 
They are freely available at:
	http://izpack.org 
	http://packjacket.sf.net

IzPack is published under the terms of Apache License Version 2.0.
PackJacket is published under GPL-v3 license.

2-The scope of rights granted by GUAJE users

Jose Maria Alonso Moral grants free patrimony rights to use, modify or integrate GUAJE in any other software (as the users see fit) on condition that:
* Any new copy of GUAJE mentions Jose Maria Alonso Moral's copyright
* The user must acknowledge reception (and use) of GUAJE by signing the present document (see paragraph 5)
Any modification in GUAJE itself should be signalled as such and made available to all subsequent users
* The user respects this license along with the licenses related to all those auxiliar tools called by GUAJE

3- Copying GUAJE
Jose Maria Alonso Moral grants by this document the right to copy GUAJE in order to facilitate its distribution, in accordance with paragraph 2 above. Any and all copies of GUAJE or related documents must refer to Jose Maria Alonso Moral's copyright and include the present document.
